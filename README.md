# Skin-Cancer-Detector
The Skin Cancer Detector is an AI/ML-based project designed to identify skin cancer types using image processing and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi camera module to capture skin lesion images, which are then analyzed using deep learning models to classify them into categories such as benign or malignant.
